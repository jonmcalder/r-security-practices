# R Users

## Working with the file system
In R you can work with the file system. R can do anything you can do with files across your network so you need to be careful.

### File locations
- Working directory
- Network files

### File permissions
- Execute permissions
- Groups

### Cleanup
- The use of `on.exit`
- The use of `unlink`

## Unsafe sourcing
Don't source files from internet without checking them!

You should understand somethting entirely before you execute it and you should verify that a file is the same file you were expecting.

Using the package `notary`, you can do this easily:
```{r}
library(notary)
```

## Dynamic string creation


## Password handling

## Dynamic code execution

## System calls
