# Who this book is for
This book is aimed at three (often overlapping) types of people involved with R -- users, developers, and administrators. 

The R community is pretty awesome but as a lot of us aren't trained developers, we can inadvertently do things that are security boo-boos or open us to bad people taking advantage of our systems.

As a result, we give guidance to R people to help you avoid common issues.
